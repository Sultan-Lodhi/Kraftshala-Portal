How to run this project Successfully ?

Please follow these steps :
1. Download the code folder into your system.
2. Run the sql queries in your Mysql database. Mysql queries are written in file "sql_queries_to_run"
under folder "Sql Queries". This will create your table with some data.
3. You should have a server installed in your system to run php file. I have used apache server.
4. To download the assignments files fron the front a new page will open. Just add one leading slash and you will be able to see the files. 
   (Best way to upload file is uploading to aws but for that you need aws account. So i have just saved the uploaded file to root directory but in href tag it removes the leading slash.)
5. That's it. Enjoy the code.
